# Guessing Game

![Guessing Game](../assets/guessing-game.png)

The Ten Guessing Game is a simple yet powerful demonstration of Ten's unique encryption capabilities. Players attempt to guess a secret number, with each guess requiring a token fee. The game showcases the challenges of maintaining secrecy in transparent ecosystems like Ethereum and how Ten addresses these challenges.

## **Game Mechanics**

- The game's objective is to guess a secret number.
- Each guess requires an entrance fee of 1 unit of the token (1x10^18 units make a single token).
- Correct guesses result in the player receiving all accumulated entrance fees.
- The game then resets with a new random secret number.
