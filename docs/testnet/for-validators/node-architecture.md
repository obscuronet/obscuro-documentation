# Node Architecture

## SGX Enclave and Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)
The TEN network leverages Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) enclaves to create a secure and trusted execution environment (TEE) for processing transactions and executing smart contracts. SGX enclaves are isolated regions of memory that are encrypted and protected from unauthorized access, ensuring that sensitive data remains confidential and secure. Every transaction and smart contract execution on the TEN network is processed within an SGX enclave, guaranteeing the integrity and confidentiality of the data involved. Additionally, SGX enclaves provide hardware-based attestation, enabling nodes to verify the authenticity of each other and establish trust within the network.
