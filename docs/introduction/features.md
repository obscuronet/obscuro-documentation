# Features

### 1. **Encryption: Data Confidentiality and Computational Privacy**
Ten leverages hardware-based [Trusted Execution Environments (TEE)](https://whitepaper.ten.xyz/obscuro-whitepaper/technical-background.html#trusted-execution-environment) to achieve data confidentiality and computational privacy.
  
### 2. **Scaling: Ethereum Layer 2 Rollup**
Designed as a decentralized Ethereum L2 Rollup protocol, Ten enhances the scalability of the Ethereum network.

### 3. **MEV-free: Prevention of Maximal Extractable Value**
Ten is designed to prevent [Maximal Extractable Value (MEV)](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/mev/), ensuring fairness in transaction ordering.

### 4. **RNG: Generate Random Number Securely**
Ten can generate secure random numbers without using any additional libraries or external applications. Generated random numbers are completely secure and no validator or user can peek into the generated numbers.

### 5. **Great UX: Privacy Preservation**
Ten prioritizes privacy while maintaining a seamless user experience, allowing users to access their preferred dApps and services without additional applications or extensions.

### 6. **Great Developer Experience: Efficiency and Simplicity**
Ten fills the gap between L2 rollups like Optimistic and ZK rollups. Leveraging confidential computing and economic incentives, it mirrors the efficiency and simplicity of Optimistic rollups. Developers can build on Ten using just Solidity, without needing new SDKs, frameworks or languages.

### 7. **High Performance: Fast Bridge**
Ten's design allows faster bridging of assets between Ethereum and Ten when compared to Optimistic rollups.
