# Set Up Dev Environment

## 1. Wallet Setup & Configuration

To start building on Ten, you first need to set up and configure your wallet with the Ten network.

1. **Install MetaMask**: [Install](https://metamask.io/download/) MetaMask either as a browser extension or mobile app.
2. **Configure MetaMask for Ten**:
   - Visit the [Ten Gateway](https://testnet.ten.xyz/) for wallet setup.
   - Click on 'Connect to Ten Testnet' and follow the on-screen instructions.
   - Learn more about the [Ten Gateway](/docs/tools-infrastructure/hosted-gateway).
3. **Acquire Testnet ETH Tokens**: To perform transactions, you'll need testnet ETH tokens. Refer to our [Getting tokens](/docs/getting-started/for-users/get-tokens).

## 2. Setting Up the Environment

Once your wallet is ready, you can proceed with the development and deployment of your smart contracts.

1. **Choose an IDE**: Use your preferred development environment or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Truffle, Remix, Hardhat, or Foundry. Check out IDE compatibility and its features [here](/docs/tools-infrastructure/compatible-tools).
2. **Connect IDE to MetaMask**: Ensure your chosen IDE is connected to your MetaMask wallet.
