# Get Tokens

## Use Ten Discord Faucet

To obtain Ten ETH directly on the Ten testnet, utilize the Discord faucet. Remember, ENS names won't work; use your actual address. Follow these steps:

1. Join the Ten [Discord server](https://discord.gg/HSPwgH89YK).
2. Go to the `#faucet-requests` channel under the `TESTNET INFO` category.
3. Enter `/faucet` and select the command.
4. Input your wallet address and hit enter.
5. Your wallet should receive ETH shortly.

If your wallet balance remains unchanged, double-check your wallet configuration or refer to the [set up your wallet](/docs/getting-started/for-users/setup-you-wallet) page.
